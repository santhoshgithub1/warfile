# Example Hellos World WAR-File
# Example Hello World WAR-File
I saw [this](http://centerkey.com/jboss/) post and build an example war file from it to test a JBOSS(EAP 6.4) I setted up.

The included war-file ist build with Java 1.8.0_111, but it ran without problems on a JDK7 JBOSS-EAP 6.4 server.
